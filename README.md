# About

## To-do
- [ ] **Fix filtering** (currently only one filter can be chosen at a time)
- [ ] Change conditional display type in .js
- [ ] Add full/partial translation tags/filter
- [ ] Add voiced tags/filter
- [ ] Add list-only view

- [ ] Add randomization option?
- [ ] **Make mobile-friendly**
- [ ] **Add all translations**

## How to add translations
Translation info is stored in the data.csv file. Each row lists the Name, Year, Source, Type, Unit/Character, Link, and Translator (other columns may be added later).

You can create a .csv file from any spreadsheet. This archive uses [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w1Pz199WghMtNz91bLLn16y9VZvkEARFXQPHLcQiRVI/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet on Google Sheets. After updating the spreadsheet, you can download the .csv from the File menu. Afterwards, you can replace the data.csv file with the contents of the updated file.
